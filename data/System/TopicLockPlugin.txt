---++ Usage
Put the %<nop>TOPICLOCK% macro anywhere in your topic or template. This macro gets expanded to either
   * a link to lock down the topic (read/write access to current user only)
   * a link to unlock the topic
   * a note, that locking down is not allowed

!WikiGuest is always forbidden to change the lock state.

This macro takes the following parameters (all are optional):

| *Parameter* | *Explanation* |
| =topic= | Default is the current topic. You can specify a different topic here. |
| =web= | Default is current web. You can specify a different topic here. |
| =lockformat= | Show this, if the topic is not locked and the user is allowed to lock it. |
| =unlockformat= | Show this, if the topic is locked. |
| =forbiddenlockformat= | Show this, if the topic is locked elsewhere or the current user is not allowed to set a lock. |

The format strings may contain a =$url= parameter which gets expanded to the locking-url.
=$percnt=, =$dollar= and =$n= behave as expected.

---++ Examples
<verbatim>
%TOPICLOCK{ lockformat="[[$url][Lock this Topic]]" unlockformat="[[$url][Unlock this Topic]]" forbiddenformat="totally forbidden to lock this Topic" }%
</verbatim>
